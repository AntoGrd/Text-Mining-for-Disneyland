## Summary

We have carried out an NLP project for DisneyLand Paris. Their objective was to be able to analyse the reviews of their sites and hotels through sites such as tripadvisor, booking or google. So we scrapped the reviews of these sites, and made a dashbord on streamlit by performing many analyses with the Word2Vec library of python.

Web Scrapping- NLP analysis - Streamlit app -On the behalf of Disneyland's Customer Experience Integration Team.

Attached, the python files created fort the Streamlit app.

**Pages : pages of the app

**Functions : functions to be embbeded

How does it work ?

# Create a virtual environmment (with visual code  (vscode) for instance)
- do not forget to install the requested librairies such as streamlit, plotly.graphs_objs (interactive plots), pandas and numpy (c. requirements.tx)
- import the pages folder
- import the functions besides the Pages folder (you are still in the environment, but not in the Pages folder)
- run the app with "streamlit run Accueil.py"
